Database Normalization Summary - AirBnB Clone
🎯 Objective Achieved
Successfully normalized the AirBnB Clone database to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
________________________________________
📊 Quick Overview
Aspect	Result
Normalization Level	Third Normal Form (3NF) ✅
Total Tables	6 (User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message)
Redundancy	Eliminated ✅
Data Integrity	Enforced via Foreign Keys ✅
Update Anomalies	Prevented ✅
________________________________________
🔍 Normalization Process
Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
Rule: Eliminate repeating groups, ensure atomic values
Actions Taken:
•	✅ All columns contain atomic (single) values
•	✅ No multi-valued fields (e.g., no "amenities: WiFi, Pool, Parking")
•	✅ Each column has consistent data type
Example:
❌ BEFORE: Property (amenities: "WiFi, Pool, Parking")
✅ AFTER:  Property, Amenity, Property_Amenity (junction table)
________________________________________
Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
Rule: Eliminate partial dependencies (all attributes must depend on entire primary key)
Actions Taken:
•	✅ Used single-column UUID primary keys (no composite keys)
•	✅ No partial dependencies possible with single-column PKs
•	✅ All non-key attributes fully depend on primary key
Example:
❌ BEFORE: Booking (booking_id, property_id, property_name, guest_name)
           - property_name depends only on property_id (partial dependency)

✅ AFTER:  Booking (booking_id, property_id, user_id, dates)
           Property (property_id, name, ...)
           User (user_id, name, ...)
________________________________________
Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
Rule: Eliminate transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes)
Actions Taken:
•	✅ Separated User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, Message into distinct tables
•	✅ All non-key attributes depend directly on primary key only
•	✅ No attribute depends on another non-key attribute
Example:
❌ BEFORE: Booking (booking_id, guest_email, property_name, host_email)
           - host_email depends on property, not booking (transitive)

✅ AFTER:  Booking (booking_id, property_id, user_id)
           Property (property_id, host_id)
           User (user_id, email)

📋 Schema Validation
Table-by-Table Analysis
Table	1NF	2NF	3NF	Notes
User	✅	✅	✅	All attributes depend directly on user_id
Property	✅	✅	✅	All attributes depend directly on property_id
Booking	✅	✅	✅	No transitive dependencies
Payment	✅	✅	✅	Separate from Booking (no redundancy)
Review	✅	✅	✅	Links to Property and User independently
Message	✅	✅	✅	Sender/recipient both reference User

🔄 Before vs After
❌ BEFORE (Unnormalized)
-- Single table with redundant data
Booking_Denormalized (
    booking_id,
    guest_name,           -- Repeated for every booking
    guest_email,          -- Repeated for every booking
    property_name,        -- Repeated for every booking
    property_location,    -- Repeated for every booking
    host_name,            -- Repeated for every booking
    start_date,
    end_date,
    payment_amount,       -- Mixed with booking data
    payment_method        -- Mixed with booking data
)
Problems:
•	Guest info duplicated across bookings
•	Property info duplicated across bookings
•	Cannot store user without booking
•	Update anomalies (change email in one place, missed in others)
________________________________________
✅ AFTER (Normalized to 3NF)
-- Separate normalized tables

User (
    user_id,              -- Primary Key
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    role
)

Property (
    property_id,          -- Primary Key
    host_id,              -- Foreign Key → User
    name,
    location,
    pricepernight
)

Booking (
    booking_id,           -- Primary Key
    property_id,          -- Foreign Key → Property
    user_id,              -- Foreign Key → User
    start_date,
    end_date,
    total_price,
    status
)

Payment (
    payment_id,           -- Primary Key
    booking_id,           -- Foreign Key → Booking
    amount,
    payment_method,
    payment_date
)

Review (
    review_id,            -- Primary Key
    property_id,          -- Foreign Key → Property
    user_id,              -- Foreign Key → User
    rating,
    comment
)

Message (
    message_id,           -- Primary Key
    sender_id,            -- Foreign Key → User
    recipient_id,         -- Foreign Key → User
    message_body,
    sent_at
)
Benefits:
•	✅ No data redundancy
•	✅ Single source of truth for each entity
•	✅ Easy updates (change email once in User table)
•	✅ Can store entities independently
•	✅ Data integrity via foreign keys
________________________________________
🎯 Key Achievements
1. Eliminated Redundancy
•	User information stored once (not repeated per booking)
•	Property information stored once (not repeated per booking)
•	Payment information separated from booking data
2. Prevented Anomalies
•	Insert Anomaly: Can now add users without bookings
•	Update Anomaly: Update user email in one place only
•	Delete Anomaly: Deleting a booking doesn't delete user data
3. Ensured Data Integrity
•	Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
•	Cascade rules maintain referential integrity
•	Check constraints validate data at database level
4. Improved Performance
•	Smaller table sizes (no duplicate data)
•	Efficient queries via indexed foreign keys
•	Optimized storage usage
